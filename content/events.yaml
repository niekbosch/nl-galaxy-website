      This course aims at PhD students, postdocs and senior researchers who are interested in planning, 
      or already working with next-generation sequencing. We welcome researchers from both the genomics 
      and bioinformatics fields. Currently available technologies as well as hardware solutions will be 
      presented and discussed. The focus of the course will be on data and ways to analyse the data.

      The BioSB research school and partner LUMC are organizing a 3-day course
      on RNA-seq data analysis. This is an advanced course for people with
      experience in NGS. The course will consist of lectures, Galaxy and R
      practicals and will cover the analysis pipelines for differential
      transcript expression and variant calling. Examples will be taken from
      human and mouse studies. The course does not cover prokaryotic RNA
      profiling nor plant- and metagenomics aspects
